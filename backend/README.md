# backend

The backend for our grading solution supports operations on user-sensitive data.

## Get Started Developing

You will need:
* [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [`go` >= go1.16.3](https://go.dev/doc/install)

```sh
# make sure you're in the backend directory
make
./backend
```

The `handler` folder is where code for our endpoints goes. All endpoints can expect
to be passed a `Context` of type [`handler.Context`](./handler/context.go). Please
consult the provided type and below code sample for information.

```go
// The below handler shows how to acquire a `handler.Context` object
// from the wrapping `echo.Context`.
//
// The contained Context type supplies a database connection and JWT
// authorization claims, if a user has supplied a token in the
// "Authorization" header of their request.
func MyHandler(cc echo.Context) error {
  c := cc.(*Context)
  return nil
}
```

## Exposed Endpoints

### Conventions

Responses are formatted with JSON. Variable names passed in the request are documented
using `snake_case`, but responses will provide variable names that **are actually** in
`camelCase`.

All endpoints except for `POST /login` and `POST /user` expect an `Authorization` header
in the HTTP request bearing a JWT returned by either of these endpoints.

Any `GET` request does not require a body, only an `Authorization` header.

### `POST /user`

Login as an user, returning a JWT for future requests. Please please **please** only
send this on TLS.

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "username": "Smallberg",
  "password": "MYSECRETPASSWORD DONT TELL ANYONE LOL",
  "type":     "professor",
}
```

#### Response Format

```json
{
  "token": "SomeLongStringOfBase64"
}
```

## Appendix

### Testing the Backend

There's a few ways to test the backend.

#### Testing it the Go way

If we have any Go test files (e.g., `myfile_test.go`), then
they are automatically discoverable and runnable with the
`go` binary that builds the backend.

```
go test -v
```

#### Testing it Live

To test the endpoint you've created with some dummy data, you can use [curl](https://curl.se/) or some other simple
HTTP program (even devtools work).
The below example `POST`s some data to the endpoint `/class`.

```sh
curl -d '{ "username": "leo", "password": "mypass" }' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' localhost:8080/login
```

If you have the backend running on port 8080, this will automatically be reflected.

### Useful Tools

If you want to see how your SQL query is running, [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)
or another similar database browser makes life much easier.

You can also use the CLI program `sqlite3` to investigate the database that you have created (by default `test.db`).
Below is an example:

```
âžœ  backend git:(==leo/sqlite) sqlite3 test.db
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> SELECT * FROM Accounts;

```
